Subject: [PATCH] [CUMULUS] add initial debian/ directory

Add the usual suspects to the debian directory.

As a starting point, use the files from the latest Ubuntu version,
13-0ubuntu2.

The 3 shim binaries, fbx64.efi, mmx64.efi and shimx64.efi are
installed to /usr/share/shim.

These binaries are unsigned.

+Standards-Version: 3.9.8

+Package: shim-unsigned
+Architecture: amd64

+Description: boot loader to chain-load signed boot loaders under Secure Boot
+ This package provides a minimalist boot loader which allows verifying
+ signatures of other UEFI binaries against either the Secure Boot DB/DBX or
+ against a built-in signature database.  Its purpose is to allow a small,
+ infrequently-changing binary to be signed by the UEFI CA, while allowing
+ an OS distributor to revision their main bootloader independently of the CA.
